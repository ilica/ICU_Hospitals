d3 hover over map and animation showing the percent of ICU beds occupied at hospitals around NYC.

Available to view at http://ilicamahajan.com/ICU_Hospitals/.
First, an animation will play displaying the percent of ICU beds occupied over the last 90 days. At the conclusion of the animation, the final map will become interactive, allowing the user to hover over various hospitals to view their latest statistics in more detail.

How I preprocessed the data to clean and simplify the datasets is located in process_data.ipyb
All d3.js code is in the chart.js file.
